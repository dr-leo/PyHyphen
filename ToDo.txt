To Do's for PyHyphen 3.0
===============================


1. readme.rst: Code example should not start with Manual dict installs
as this is no longer encouraged.

2. dictools: I suggest to Import ElementTree not globally but in the
parse function for Performance. The XML stuff is only required when
new dicts are loaded.

3. Hyphenator API: I suggest to look at pyphen and maybe steel some of
its Hyphenator methods (medium priority).

4. Hyphen package should have a doc string. Perhaps simply elevate it
from hyphenator.py

5. License: Apache 2.0?

6. remove Windows binaries from the sdist. Provide wheels for Windows and macOS instead (see below). 

7.Build and deploy wheels with binary support for Windows and MacOS and Py27, 34, 35 and 36
 using https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel 

8. The old config.py contained a non-exhaustive list of language
strings as an Inspiration. I think this is useful if Imperfect and
should go back into the hyphen or dictools module and be documented as
an Inspiration. Otherwise there is no easy way to find out which
dictsare out there. Ideally there should be a way to query a list of
available dicts online... Maybe in our next life we should build a
REST Service for this steeling all the dicts from LibreOffice.
LibreOffice might Change their dir structure or xcu file Format and
the whole Thing blows up... But maybe there is already such a Service
offered by some NLP folks...
