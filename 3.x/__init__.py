hyphen - hyphenation for Python

This package adds hyphenation functionality to the Python programming language.
You may also wish to have a look at the module 'textwrap2' distributed jointly
with this package.

1. Overview

The gole of the PyHyphen project is to add hyphenation functionality to the Python programming
language. PyHyphen consists of the package 'hyphen' and the module 'textwrap2'

1.1 The hyphen package contains:
    - at top level the definition of the class 'Hyphenator' each instance of which
      can hyphenate words using a dictionary compatible with the hyphenation feature of
      OpenOffice and Mozilla.
      The former class 'hyphenator' is deprecated
      as of version 0.10 as class names conventially begin with a capital letter.
    - the module dictools contains useful functions such as automatic downloading and
    - the module dictools contains useful functions automatically downloading and
      installing dictionaries from a configurable repository. By default, the
      OpenOffice repository is used.
     - config is a configuration file initialized at install time with default values
       for the directory where dictionaries are searched, and the repository for future
       downloads of dictionaries.
     - hyph_en_US.dic is the hyphenation dictionary for US English as found on
       the OpenOffice.org repository.
    - 'hnjmodule' is the C extension module that does all the ground work. It
      contains the C library hyphen-2.4. I cannot think of a reason
      to access the wrapper class exported by 'hnjmodule' directly rather than through
      the top level wrapper class hyphen.hyphenator. So 'hnjmodule' is disregarded by
      'from hyphen import *'. Note that hyphenation dictionaries are invisible to the
      Python programmer. But each hyphenator object has a member 'language' which is a
      string showing the language of the dictionary in use.



1.2 The module 'textwrap2'

This module is an enhanced though backwards compatible version of the module
'textwrap' known from the Python standard library. Not very surprisingly, it adds
hyphenation functionality to 'textwrap'.

1.3 hyphen_test (in the demo/ subdirectory)

This Python script is a framework for running large tests of the hyphen package.
A test is a 3-tuple of a text file (typically a word list), its encoding and a
list of strings specifying a dictionary to be applied to the word list. Adding a test
is as easy as writing a function call. All results are logged.


2. Code examples

from hyphen import Hyphenator
from hyphen.dictools import *

# Download and install some dictionaries in the default directory using the derault
# repository, usually the OpenOffice website
for lang in ['de_DE', 'fr_FR', 'en_UK', 'ru_RU']:
    if not is_installed(lang): install(lang)

# Create some hyphenators
h_de = Hyphenator('de_DE')
h_en = Hyphenator('en_US')

# Now hyphenate some words

print h_en.pairs('beautiful')
[['beau', 'tiful'], ['beauti', 'ful']]

print h_en.wrap('beautiful', 6)
['beau-', 'tiful']

print h_en.wrap('beautiful', 7)
['beauti-', 'ful']


4. How to get dictionaries?

 Visit http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries for a
 complete list. If you know the language and country code of your favorite
 dictionary (e.g. 'it_IT' for Italian) and have internet access, you can take
 advantage of the install function in the hyphen.dictools module. See the code
 example above (2.) for more details, or read the module documentation.

            This is inspired by the file names of
            OpenOffice's hyphenation dictionaries.
