===============================
To Do's for PyHyphen 1.0beta1
===============================


Maybe it was a bit early to switch to v1.0, although not a single bug has been reported since.

However, there is a lot to do before it deserves versioned 1.0 final, and yet more
in terms of adding useful features.

I haven't got the time to do this, so helping hands are more than welcome.

1. High priority ToDo's
=================

1.1 Use the new OpenOffice extension format
--------------------------

* make dictools access the new OpenOffice extension site. So far, dictionaries are downloaded from an old site
  that is being phased out. But I haven't found any information on the OO website on how to
  retrieve URLs for OO extensions containing dictionaries. Also, the new extension format needs to be clarified.
  It uses XML metadata etc.


1.2 Move to the stable C API introduced with Python 3.2
----------------------------------------------------------

* Modify the C extension module (not the whole hnjhyphen lib) acording to the stable API
* modify setup.py in order to check if we are on Python >= 3.2, only then use the new API to compile.



2. Medium priority
=========================

2.1 Pure Python rewrite of the C library
------------------------------------------

Reimplement the C library in pure Python to make it compatible with
Iron Python etc. Wilbert Berendsen's
`hyphenator <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hyphenator/0.5.1>`_ looks like a good starting point.
