hyphen - hyphenation for Python

This package contains the following items:

* class 'Hyphenator': wrapper class for libhyphen. Each instance
  uses its own hyphenation dictionary.
* 'dict_info': meta data on locally installed dictionaries
* 'load_dict_info' and 'save_dict_info': convenience functions to load and save
  meta date from and to a local file
